                <p class="speech-bubble-right"> What are your thoughts on cryptocurrency as a technology? As there are
                    quite a few tech people and some people from finance, over the years there have been ups and
                    downs in cryptocurrency.
                    As a technology I find it interesting but as a currency it’s sus. Would like to know thoughts from
                    people with more experience in the industry! Thanks

                </p>



                <p class="speech-bubble-left">
                    Coming as a noob here :-

                    Technology is really promising that's why even the Indian government has started e-rupi (tokenized
                    version of the Indian rupee).

                    On the other hand, the way these cryptocurrencies were exploited by tech people to lure enthusiasts
                    and gain monetary benefits out of it, gave it the bad name!

                    Somehow I feel, at least for India, given the UPI is there, cryptocurrencies make lesser sense in
                    terms of pros like cost and time.

                    But for other countries, this might be useful given they still rely on higher transaction fees for
                    verifying transactions and take a good amount of time to settle it.

                    My bias is towards government based semi-regulated cryptocurrencies because they come with trust
                    along with other advantages
                </p>

                <p class="speech-bubble-left">
                    I have serious reservations about government owned or operated digital currency (different from
                    crypto). It gives enormous control to the government over our lives. Were the farmers in Canada
                    denied access to their money and bank accounts because they were protesting against the government?
                    Government operated digital money is an instrument of fascism. And fascism by definition is the
                    confluence of government and corporate interests.
                </p>

                <p class="speech-bubble-left">
                    I do like the Indian government's take on the tokenized version of the Indian rupee. It has immense
                    potential, especially during settlement between the banks. It's easy for banks to manage money.
                    Another plus is that you do not need any bank account to use e-rupi. RBI is directly at the back
                    end. Fast, secured and backed by the central bank!

                    Oops I only know that my UPI is not connected to Ambani's account but yet I spend like it is.

                    Just a general question :-

                    What is everyone's take on
                    Term Life Insurance,
                    Worth buying?


                    I have it, and it kinda gives a sense of relief knowing family is insured.
                </p>
                <p class="speech-bubble-left">
                    Yes. Must. Younger the better.
                </p>

                <p class="speech-bubble-left">
                    Absolutely, Plus one
                </p>

                <p class="speech-bubble-left">
                    Yeah it is. I think the first priority after getting a job is to get Term life insurance and
                    Mediclaim.

                    I have seen terms and conditions of Mediclaim policies and major critical diseases gets the coverage
                    after 1 year or 2 years span.

                    So it’s better to have moderate Mediclaim policies.
                </p>

                <p class="speech-bubble-left">
                    Don'ts on term life insurance.

                    1. Buy plain insurance where you have to pay a premium once a year. Do not buy the one where they
                    recommended you to make all payments in the first 4/5 years.

                    2. Do not club your term insurance with additional schemes such as "get your premium back" or
                    combined with ULIP. One must keep insurance & investments separate.

                    3. Have a decent cover, should be greater than any current debt you have (home loan etc). Do not buy
                    a separate home loan insurance when buying a home loan from a bank. Those are very costly and again
                    they take all the premiums at once.

                    4. Don't mix up health & term insurance.

                    5. The only add-on I suggest is terminal illness rider.

                    Hope it helps!
                    And please personally read all the terms & conditions before buying.
