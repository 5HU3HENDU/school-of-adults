            <p>Hi all, this is Asmi Shah, VP of data and technology in Anuva, Mumbai. We are building an Indian genomic
                biobank to contribute to the pharmas in their global genomic research. By formal training, I am a
                bioinformatician with a PhD in natural sciences. I am based out of Ahmedabad, Gujarat.

                I like to read, watch good content, listen audiobooks, exploring the podcasts lately. True crime and
                specifically historical ones intrigue me a lot! Like nature, travel. Concentrating newly on fitness
                while coping with chronic health issues through naturopathy, yoga, meditation. Pretty new there!
                <br>
                Would love to discuss tech, biology or anything and everything !
                <br>

                awesome minds! <br>

                Sorry for being super late on the first day of school, habitual mistake.. yikes! Left the college couple
                of years back but college hasn‚Äôt left me yet.. lol XD <br>

                So a bit of myself.. I‚Äôm a Software Engineer by profession and have worked with investment banks (Bank
                of America and JP Morgan) for more than 5years now. This experience has enabled me to learn about
                finance along with crucial role tech plays to make it work real faster.
                <br>
                Recently I‚Äôve taken a break from work and have decided to pursue masters in data science. Will be
                joining the University next month, hoping things to go well! <br>
                Glad to see couple of data science experts already onboard, rn I‚Äôm dancing with joy :P <br>
                Keen to get guidance from you all. And also excited to share whatever cool stuff I‚Äôve ever known!! <br>

                In my free time, I learn, eat and watch all that is Japanese :) <br>
                I like getting help from self-help books and meet people in general! <br>
                I love organising stuff.. be it a messy room or file folders on my PC :) <br>
                Lately farming is the one thing, I really wanna have my hands on! <br>

                Hope we all share diverse experiences with each other and grow together!!

                I am Sravan from Bengaluru, I am a data engineer.
                <br>
                The only hobby I am continuing is hanging out with friends.
                <br>
                Apart from this I tried many things in the last few years like cycling, swimming, badminton, Acrylic
                painting, piano, Guitar, watching old movies at home and new movies in theatres, travelling to old
                temples with my friends to enjoy the architecture is what I started a couple of months ago.
                <br>
                I am into all the above stuff after realising that learning so many technologies and sticking your back
                to the office chair for long hours doesn't fetch you anything except a little higher pay.
