                Sorry for being super late on the first day of school, habitual mistake.. yikes! Left the college couple
                of years back but college hasn‚Äôt left me yet.. lol XD <br>

                So a bit of myself.. I‚Äôm a Software Engineer by profession and have worked with investment banks (Bank
                of America and JP Morgan) for more than 5years now. This experience has enabled me to learn about
                finance along with crucial role tech plays to make it work real faster.
                <br>
                Recently I‚Äôve taken a break from work and have decided to pursue masters in data science. Will be
                joining the University next month, hoping things to go well! <br>

                Keen to get guidance from you all. And also excited to share whatever cool stuff I‚Äôve ever known!! <br>

                In my free time, I learn, eat and watch all that is Japanese :) <br>
                I like getting help from self-help books and meet people in general! <br>
                I love organising stuff.. be it a messy room or file folders on my PC :) <br>
                Lately farming is the one thing, I really wanna have my hands on! <br>

                Hope we all share diverse experiences with each other and grow together!!

            <summary>Sambhav Chopra</summary>
            <p>Hey everyone! I'm a week late with my introduction, but I don't want to miss out on this week as well, so
                here it is: I am Sambhav Chopra, currently based in my hometown, Jaipur. I am one of the lucky few (or
                unlucky, depending on your POV) as I still have the opportunity to WFH at AngelOne. My work primarily
                involves M&A with young FinTech startups, and I plan to relocate to Bangalore sometime next year for
                this role. Before this, I worked as a consultant and dabbled in entrepreneurship a few times. It was
                during one of these entrepreneurial stints that I got in touch with Shubhendu. Shubhendu is one of those
                rare individuals in my life whom I have never met in person, but I really respect and am eager to meet.

                In addition to my work with startups, I have a keen interest in Formula 1 (attended the Azerbaijan GP
                this year), adventure travel, and, thanks to my upcoming wedding, I've also developed an interest in
                fitness! :P

                I'm always open to hosting anyone who visits Jaipur, and as a fellow foodie, I can take you to the best
                eateries in town. Looking forward to getting to know a few people here :)</p>

            <p>Hello Everyone, thrilled to be a part of this group üòÑ
                <br>
                I'm Saurabh Chougule, I work in Investment Banking as a Valuation Consultant for Mortgage Backed
                Securities in Wells Fargo.
                <br>
                As a creative outlet outside of my 9to5, I like to recreate restaurant quality dishes with unmatched
                accuracy to the original and play piano from time to time. I am also a huge F1 fan and a tech
                enthusiast.
                <br>
                I do like to learn a lot about managing personal finances, eager to share my learnings with each one of
                you !

            <p>Hi, I'm Saurabh Nevgi from Mumbai but currently living in Delhi. I like to explore and challenge myself
                on regular basis. Previously I worked as a chef in cafe, then I was part of bike modification workshop,
                CAD trainer for 2 days and after that Purchase Executive in automotive sector. Managed to settle in this
                field in past three years.

                Love for people and money is endless for me, so I try to keep both of them very close to me. Currently
                in search of definition of ""well settled life"". In my me time I go for cycling, running or gaming
                (playing ghost recon wildlands nowadays), sleeping.

                Interacting with people having common interests will fine tune your skills/logics, however when people
                having different interests comes together we get to know the world in a unique way and who knows, one
                can find more interesting things to do! Glad to be a part of such community ü§ü</p>

            <p>Hello everyone,
                <br>
                I am Sravan from Bengaluru, I am a data engineer.
                <br>
                The only hobby I am continuing is hanging out with friends.
                <br>
                Apart from this I tried many things in the last few years like cycling, swimming, badminton, Acrylic
                painting, piano, Guitar, watching old movies at home and new movies in theatres, travelling to old
                temples with my friends to enjoy the architecture is what I started a couple of months ago.
                <br>
                I am into all the above stuff after realising that learning so many technologies and sticking your back
                to the office chair for long hours doesn't fetch you anything except a little higher pay.
