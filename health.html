                    I am 54 and do around 20km cycling morning and 8km in evening. Off late feels like recovery taking
                    longer. Any recommendations other than reducing the activity level.

                    Do you stay hydrated enough? Around 3-4L water per day

                    A break once every 2-3 days would be helpful plus doing some warm up stretches for calves, shin,
                    hamstrings, etc. would be very helpful
                </p>

                <p class="speech-bubble-left">
                    My exercise program :
                    Monday, Wednesday and saturday - strengthening exercise/cardio . Before exercise warm up nd after
                    exercise stretching.

                    Tuesday, Thursday and Friday- yoga nd mediation

                    Sunday -light aerobics exercise with soothing music/small trek

                    Diet : protein more carb less according to my body 3-4L water intake (winter /rainy season)
                    For mental health I recommend guided imagination techniques for stress, sleep and pregnancy related
                    issues

                    Does anyone have any views on diet plans?

                    One which shouldn't be too complicated but yet effective enough
                </p>

                <p class="speech-bubble-left">
                    I follow Intermittent fasting.

                    But I eat well during my eating hours.

                    This has helped me understand what my body really requires than blindly eating at fixed hours
                </p>

                <p class="speech-bubble-left">
                    Consumption of food should be based on body clock instead of clock. indian households follow the
                    later and we all grew up on that habit. I found that after a few trial and error i found the right
                    timing based on my body clock, and activity level. Now only eat when body ask for it and it works
                    fine for me.
                </p>

                <p class="speech-bubble-left">
                    Start monitoring your food habits and timelines
                    Do it for atleast 2-3 weeks

                    Only when you consciously know what are you consuming and when you can act on it.

                </p>

                <p class="speech-bubble-left">
                    Intermittent fasting is quite difficult for normal person. If any one want to try diet 1st do remove
                    carbs form your diet like if u eat wheat roti shift to jawar/bajra/ Or mix contains roti . Cut down
                    one- one food elements daywise for 21 days as per your food priority and body alarm bcz making a
                    habbit for our body take minimum 3 to 4 weeks . After ths routine which is already set up in body u
                    can go for intermittent fasting nd while fasting time if u feel hungry thn u can take light drinks
                    lemon tea / lemon grass tea (hari patti chai) /warm water+ lemon( nothing elseðŸ˜…)

                <p class="speech-bubble-left">
                    Earlier I used to snack a lot very frequently which kind of affected my overall meal cravings
                    because till the time I got to eat my lunch or dinner I was already half full.
                    So rather than eating randomly, i fixed my breakfast and lunch time so the body gets to adapt the
                    schedule of food intakes

                    Eating processed food is the main issue I guess for most of us because when we crave something we
                    immediately go to the readily available source for example: cookies, maggie and stuff.
                    So rather than limiting my urge i limited the stock of processed food at home. So even after I'm
                    craving Maggie I can't eat it because it's not available at home. Then magically you see that apple
                    in the corner ðŸ˜‚
                </p>

                <p class="speech-bubble-left">
                    One more thing everyone needs to follow is be mindful about the ingredients when you buy anything
                    rather than following what's written on the face cover.
                    Eg. Whole wheat biscuits or breads have Refined flour (Maida) as its primary ingredient.

                    Wheat breads are nothing but colour added to it, they aren't made of Wheat.

                    So the point is watch what you eat.

                <p class="speech-bubble-right">
                    For mental health, what worked for me was:
                    1. eating healthy
                    2. practicing gratitude daily for even the smallest things that you have
                    3. Doing guided meditation

                    To keep me motivated towards by goals what worked for me apart from above was follow this morning
                    routine:
                    1. S for Silent: just breathe n practice silence for at least 5 mins
                    2. M for mind movie: Imagine you dream life for 2 mins so that it gets feeded to ur subconscious
                    mind
                    3. A for affirmations: Do affirmations like I am the best, i am worthy etc (everyone has their own)
                    4. T for thank you: Thank God/universe/the positive force or who ever you beleive in for giving you
                    all that you have. Thank yourself! thank the person who have been there with you in those tought
                    times.

                    There is this app called woebot from Deep Learning AI. It is conversational AI and pretty good as a
                    mental health primary care provider.
                    But i find that the best therapy is rest and green spaces....

                    Anyone here tried meal prep? For the week or something...
                    Saw this as a trend and have thought of trying it
                </p>

                <p class="speech-bubble-left">
                    Seems interesting at first, but saw some comments saying that it will lead to consumption of stale
                    foods so maybe not good
                </p>
                <p class="speech-bubble-left">
                    Tried, just generally a bad idea due to many reasons. One is that cut veggies lose a lot of
                    goodness. Two, too much thinking and so much organising. Three, lot of food ends up getting wasted
                    if family is in the mood for something else
                </p>
                <p class="speech-bubble-left">
                    I guess the problem with healthy food is that they require time and effort to cook/prepare!

                    A few easy to consume healthy foods I can think of are eggs, curd, fruits

                    Roti, rice, dal, non-veg and all do require considerable efforts (on daily basis) ðŸ¥²
